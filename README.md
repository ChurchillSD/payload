Payload gamemode mod for BF3:VU


# Compliling Web Ui

I have made a quick bat scipt which uses the "vuicc.exe" web UI complier found here: https://veniceunleashed.net/files/vuicc.exe

Just run that with the exe in the same folder to complie the current UI found in the UI folder.

# Todo:

## UI:
* Add more arrow indicators when there is a greater number of pushers
* Make the payload track look better.
* Add a time limit displayed at the top
* Add payload ESP to direct players towards it

## Backend:
* Add spawing at captured waypoints
* Add round end when payload reaches last point
* Add team detection for the UI to update
* Add payload moving backwards if not touched for a while.
